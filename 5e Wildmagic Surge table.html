                                    <span>Basis for wild magic</span>
                                    <p>When the world was created, it is said that all magic was wild, but over the years, with all the use by wizards, clerics, and others, the magic was bound into the form we know today. However, there still exist places where the magic hasn't been tamed yet.</p>
                                    <p>Wild Magic is an environmental effect in certain locations, considered to be extremely unreliable. In these environments, magic might be strengthened, weakened, or randomly altered. These alterations might radically alter the spell to another type, a new and unique expression of reality alteration, or even make the spell fizzle and do nothing.</p>
                                    <p>Wild magic areas can be as small as a 5ft radius, and the biggest one known is about half a mile across. These areas are rare and often in hard-to-come-by places far away from colonized lands, but exceptions do exist.</p>
                                    <p>In a wild magic area, spells and spell-like abilities function in radically different and sometimes dangerous ways. Any spell or spell-like ability used in a wild magic area has a chance to go awry. The caster must make a wild magic check (Standard DC is 1 + the level of the spell or effect, but it can be higher) for the magic to function normally. Failure on this check means that something strange happens; roll on <a href="#Basic_Table">Great Surge Table</a>.</p>
                                    <h2><span>Da Great Wild Surge Table</span></h2>
                                    <p>Unless otherwise noted, the surge takes effect where the original spell that triggered the wild surge was supposed to occur. The below tables, while long, are only a small fraction of the possible results of a wild surge. The DM is encouraged to change effects they don't like into more appropriate effects for their campaign. </p>
                                    <p>Tables like the one below cannot take into account the situation at the instant of casting. It is not feasible to create tailored effects for every spell used in every possible way. Therefore, it is quite likely that some wild surge results will make no sense, or are impossible. In these cases, the wild surge has no effect.</p>
                                    <p><b>Rule 1) Wild surge result: makes no sense or is impossible = Wild surge has no effect</b></p>
                                    <p>For example, if a wizard were casting <i>Knock</i> on a door and triggered a wild surge with the effect "Target changes sex", it would be impossible, since doors do not have a sex (or at least not in most DnD games). Therefore, the wild surge has no effect.</p>
